                Average: The Akbash Dog requires average grooming effort. Cutting the dog's hair by a professional groomer isn't essential. Brushing the dog's coat is useful to reduce shedding. Ears
                and eyes should be cleaned regularly to avoid infections. Don't skip the seasonal flea treatment too. Dog nail trimming and dog bath can be helpful sometimes. Check the local pet store
                for dog grooming supplies and find the best dog shampoo to keep its coat healthy and to give your dog a pleasant experience of a dog bath. If you don't have the time, skill or money to
                take care of your Akbash Dog, search for a dog groomer or clipping service in your area and book an appointment. Maybe you're lucky to have a dog boarding service that includes
                grooming or walk in dog bath places nearby.

                The Akbash Dog is an average drooler. Drooling is the unintentional saliva flowing outside of the mouth. It can be completely normal or a sign of a health problem. If you notice any
                change in your dog's drooling habit, you should contact a vet as soon as possible.

                Reproductive cycle of the female Akbash Dog: The first period called Proestrus lasts for about 9 days. During this time the females start to attract males. You can notice by swelling
                vulva and bloody discharge. The second part is the Estrus when the bitch is receptive for the male. It lasts for about 3 to 11 days. The sign of the proestrus part is the soft and
                enlarged vulva. The discharge decreases and lightens in color. The third part is the Diestrus. Normally, it occurs around day 14. In this period the bitch’s discharge changes for vivid
                red and coming to its end. The vulva returns to average, and she will no longer permit mating. The fourth part called the Anestrus. The time frame between heat periods normally lasts
                about six months.

                More frequent breeding is not healthy. It is very important not to buy a dog from a puppy mill, where the needs of the pups and their mothers are ignored. It's an inhumane high-volume
                dog breeding facility, where puppies born several times a year.
